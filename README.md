# Video-Editor

Video Editor for Android based on FMPEG engine

Android application for video editing

My first android project, so any forking is good. You are welcome to
use/edit the project.

Basically you can edit/convert/format any kind of video right on your
android device.
You can do the same with your songs.

FFMPEG engine is used at the core to perform my functions.

I would be uploading screenshots in short time.

My first Commit.. So any suggestions are  welcome
